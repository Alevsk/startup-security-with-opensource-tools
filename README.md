# Compilation of open-source security tools & platforms for your startup

This compilation of open-source tools aim to provide resources you can use for some of the step of the secure development life cycle of your organisation, ie:

1. Security Training
2. Security Architecture Review
3. Security Requirements
4. Treath Modeling
5. Static Analysis
6. OpenSource Analysis
7. Dynamic Analysis
8. Penetration Testing

If you think I should add a new tool to the list you can open a github issue or send a PR directly.
